For experiments >50
- Try simple distribution of linearly separated points of 2 classes on [0,1]^2.
- Fit different models such as logistic regression, SVM, and relu networks and measure Bayes risk, training risk, test risk, and generalization
- Try to compute directly bounds on probability of some deviation from the bayes risk.

Perhaps what you want is a class of functions which will a.s. converge to Bayes minimizer. Even better is if the expectation of the learned function is the Bayes minimizer over all the drawn samples.
